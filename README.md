Database: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ttalbitt/american-football-team-stats-1998-2019

Using the database containing NFL Football statistics for each team from 1999-2019, I want to predict how sucessful a team will be given a few features. In the classification notebook, I tried to use yards, 1st downs, and avg points per drive to predict wins. After doing a decision tree on these features, my accuracy was quite less than ideal at 7.74%. I'm juite sure this is due to teams with simmilar stats having win numbers that are just a few games away from eachother, but not the same. This can be remidied by creating buckets, but for unknown reasons I could not get this to function. This will be remedied soon.
